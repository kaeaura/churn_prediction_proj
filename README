Goal

	- In-game features
		- Relation between character gender and character race among realms
		- Relation between character gender and character level among realms
		- Relation between character gender and character level among realms

	- 遊戲中角色性別與種族之間的關聯
			- In-Game Observation: 兩兩相互比較
				- Avatar characteristic
					- population
						- population growth or decay over time?
					- gender 
						- gender ratio balance? (chisq.test)
							- imbalance, # male char. > # female char.
						- ratio in each realm equal? (prop.test)
							- barely eqaul
						- gender ratio changes significatntly over time? 
							- female char. increases but not significantly
					- race
						- race ratio balance? (chisq.test)
						- ratio in each realm equal? (prop.test)
						- gender ratio changes significatntly over time?
					- level
					- time: joined time, subscription length
					- guild (bool)
					- world: time, observation length, population
				- Figure
					- figure 1: population over time:
					- figure 2: gender ratio (over realm)
						- consistency in different realm (in all game)
					- race ratio (over realm)
						- consistency in different realm (in all game)
					- gender in race (over realm)
						- consistency in different realm (in all game)
					- level distribution in gender (over realm)
						- consistency in different realm (in all game)
						- will the gender of character affect the leveling?
						- not much (how to test, the distribution similarity?)
					- level distribution in race (over realm)
						- will the race of character affect the leveling?
						- not much
					- 
			- Out-Game Infer.
				- Player characteristic
					- Nigth Owl
					- Addiction
				- Cross Validation
					- Player real data
						- city vs outtown
						- age
						- gender
			- Single Interaction
				- Channel (4)
				- Trade (2)
				- Guild Post (?)
			- World Culture
				- vs out-game infer.
				- vs in-game properties
		- Structure Needed:
			- section name! section question! significatnt section conclusion!
analysis:
gender issue
	In overview, male characters number is greater then female character number
	Male ratio in six realms:
		alice, 57.4%
		anderson, 65.5%
		doll, 65.0%
		* mermaid, 53.4% (smallest)
		red, 57.5%
		* wolf, 68.2% (largest)
	The cumulative ratio over time in six realms:
		alice, male strictly decreases from 59.3% to 57.4% (-1.9%)
		anderson, male decreases from 67.8% to 65.5% (-2.2%)
		* doll, male decreases from 67.7% to 65.0% (-2.7%) (largest decreasement)
		* mermaid, male stay low 53.4% (0%)
		red, male decreases from 60.0% to 57.5% (-2.5%)
		wolf, male decreases from 71.2% to 68.2% (-2%)

race issue
	In overview, human is the largest race , elf is the second large race, and dwarf is the smallest race. Average speaking, the ratio for human, elf, and drawf would be 5:3:2 respectively. The population in elf is slightly fading out over time.

	Elf population declines
		alice, 30.5% to 30.4%
		anderson, 32.9% to 29.1%
		doll, 32.1% to 28.6%
		mermaid 33.0% to 30.3%
		red 32.6% to 30.6%
		wolf, 32.1% to 28.5%

gender vs race issue:
	gender ratio in elf race is the most balance, and the male ratio is relative higher in human race and drawf race. Interestingly, the female ratio in elf declines overtime.
