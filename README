		- part 1: gender issue
			- 不同性別角色／玩家之間的互動關係／強度也值得分析，例如說女生角色會不會找 男生角色比較多，是誰主動？
			- 同一個帳號若有多重角色性別的話，這種玩家會不會跟別人有不同？
			- 同一個帳號若有多重角色性別的話，他／她的男／女角色會跟什麼性別的角色互 動？是主動或被動？
		- part 2: realm issue: realm的特質是否影響玩家的行為?
			- factors: realm period, realm size, realm freshness

		- Relation between character gender and character level among realms

	- 遊戲中角色性別與種族之間的關聯
			- In-Game Observation: 兩兩相互比較

					- population
						- growth trend
							- first 4 months can achieve average 60% total population
							- but decays fast, visit population often drops 3 months later since launched
						- growth trend in char. population vs account population 
							- similar, accounts seems to be more smooth
						- growth rate rank:
							- ALI > MER > RED > AND > DOL > WOL
						- growht rate rank factors may related to?
							- population size?
							- many guilds?
							- more female? (or more male?)
					- gender 
						- gender ratio balance? (chisq.test)
							- imbalance, # male char. > # female char.
						- gender consistancy in accounts
							- very consistancy
							- three clusters: all-female (1), half-male (2), all-male (3)

analysis:
gender issue
	In overview, male characters number is greater then female character number
	Male ratio in six realms:
		alice, 57.4%
		anderson, 65.5%
		doll, 65.0%
		* mermaid, 53.4% (smallest)
		red, 57.5%
		* wolf, 68.2% (largest)
	The cumulative ratio over time in six realms:
		alice, male strictly decreases from 59.3% to 57.4% (-1.9%)
		anderson, male decreases from 67.8% to 65.5% (-2.2%)
		* doll, male decreases from 67.7% to 65.0% (-2.7%) (largest decreasement)
		* mermaid, male stay low 53.4% (0%)
		red, male decreases from 60.0% to 57.5% (-2.5%)
		wolf, male decreases from 71.2% to 68.2% (-2%)

race issue
	In overview, human is the largest race , elf is the second large race, and dwarf is the smallest race. Average speaking, the ratio for human, elf, and drawf would be 5:3:2 respectively. The population in elf is slightly fading out over time.

	Elf population declines
		alice, 30.5% to 30.4%
		anderson, 32.9% to 29.1%
		doll, 32.1% to 28.6%
		mermaid 33.0% to 30.3%
		red 32.6% to 30.6%
		wolf, 32.1% to 28.5%

gender vs race issue:
	gender ratio in elf race is the most balance, and the male ratio is relative higher in human race and drawf race. Interestingly, the female ratio in elf declines overtime.
